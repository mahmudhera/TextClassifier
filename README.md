# TextClassifier
This is a class project to implement a text classifier. Multiple xml files downloaded from stackexchange were used in the project. Two classifiers have been implemented in the project: KNN and Naive-Bayes. The xml documents are splitted into training, validating and testing points, and then a comparison between the two types of classifiers are shown.

The project was implemented using Java.
